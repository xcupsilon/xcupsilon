# Rain Yan

Hello there! :wave:😊

My name is Xiaocong, though usually I just go by Rain :)

Check out my personal website at https://xiaocongyan.com/!

I am a college student majoring in CS & Graphics (DMD). I am really interested in both the technical and artistic aspect of real-time lighting and rendering. You can find my 3D artwork here at: https://www.artstation.com/xiaocongyan

In my free time, to unwind, I also like to play games and watch some cultural shows with my friends. Being an aspiring traveler, I dream to be able to travel the world sometimes and capture the beautiful things & memories with my camera. I have an unsplash page for my photos (I haven't updated in a while lol): https://unsplash.com/@xiaocongyan

よろしくお願いします！

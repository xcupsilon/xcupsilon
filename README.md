# Rain Yan

Hello there! :wave:

My name is Xiaocong, though usually I just go by Rain :)

I am a college freshman majoring in CS & Graphics (DMD). Academically, I am really interested in the field of ML/AI, graphics, as well as astronomy and astrophysics. In my free time, I like to learn new skills and practice on existing ones. To unwind, I also like to play games and watch some cultural shows with my friends. Lastly, being an aspiring traveler, I dream to be able to travel the world sometimes and capture the beautiful things & memories with my camera.

よろしくお願いします！
